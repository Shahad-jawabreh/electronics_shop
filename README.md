# Electronics Shop - Laravel Project

## Project Description

After finishing their hardware graduation projects, students often end up with leftover electronic parts they don't know what to do with. Many try to sell these parts in Facebook groups and other marketplaces, but their posts get lost among numerous others. Buyers also spend a lot of time searching and comparing prices.

This project aims to create a website/app that gathers all these parts in one place. So, any student with leftover or unused parts can easily list them, and buyers can quickly find what they need without wasting time.

Additionally, since choosing a project idea is often challenging for students, the platform includes a dedicated section to suggest project ideas along with the parts required. An AI feature allows students to submit their project idea and get feedback on its difficulty level and the parts they might need.
